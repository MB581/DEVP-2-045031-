PROJECT 1: MEHAK_PROJECT 1 (1)

PROJECT 2: MEHAK_045031

Here are the steps to open the Dashboard:

Ensure Anaconda Prompt is installed; if not, download and install it. Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the directory where your Python file is located. 
For example: If this file is on desktop write "cd desktop" Execute the following command to launch the dashboard: "streamlit run MEHAK_045031.py"

I have provided the PROJECT 2 in both the formats, i.e., py as well as ipynb.
